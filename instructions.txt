Before continuing, please take time to read the following:

__**What is the purpose of this study?:**__
The purpose of this study is to test different additional visual feedback methods for tilt degree, to aid in controlling the tilt mechanism with respect to mobile gaming. The study is performed in the context of a 2D platformer game similar to Doodle Jump, a vertical jumping platformer game where you are guiding the character across platforms.

__**What will a participant do in this study?:**__
First, you will be asked to answer the first part for the questionnaire, concerning questions about demographics and prior experiences. Next, you will play three game version in random order. During the game play of each version, you play time and death count will be collected, while after playing each version, you will be asked to answer the second part of the questionnaire with questions about the game and player experience. Finally, you will be asked to answer the final part of the questionnaire, focussing on the comparision of the three game versions.

__**How long will this study take?:**__
The study (gameplay + questionnaire) is expected to take around 15-30 minutes.

__**What are the possible risks or discomforts?:**__
Excessive tilting of your mobile phone could cause strain on the wrist. Please, be mindful about this. If you feel any discomfort, do not hesitate to take a break between game versions.

__**What is the conduct for data confidentially?:**__
Your responses will be kept strictly confidential, and digital data will be securely stored. Any publications based on this research will not include your name or any other individual information by which you could be identified. All of this is will be in line with the University of Utrecht: https://www.uu.nl/en/research/research-data- management/guides/policies-codes-of-conduct-and-laws.

__**What are the rights of a participant?:**__
Participation in this study is voluntary. There will not be any compensation or reward for your participation. You may choose not to participate or, if you agreed to participate, you can withdraw your participation at any time without being penalized.

# Player Character
You will play as this robot --> <Image1>
The robot will be jumping automatically and continously.

# Game goal
Ascend to the finish platform <image2> by controling and guiding the robot to jump across different types of platforms as efficiently and fast as possible. Try not to fall down off the screen to minimize the number of "deaths".

# Controls
Tilt your mobile phone to the left or right (over its y-axis or z-axis), to move the robot in the desired direction.

# Platforms
Normal <image3>; Static platform on which you can jump endlessly.
Breakable <image4>; Static platform on which you can only jump once before it disappears.
Movable <image5>; Platform that moves horizontally and on which you can jump endlessly.

# Game versions
• Control version; Without additional visual feedback on the tilt degree.
• Balance bar; On top of the screen, a balance bar will be visualized to indicate the tilt degree of your mobile phone in real-time. <image6>
• Power bars; Two power bars are visualized on the robot. The left bar (fill colour: red) indicates the level of tilt degree to the left, while the right bar (fill colour: blue) indicates the level of tilt degree to the right. <image7: Tilt a lot to the left.> <image8: Tilt slightly to the right.>

# Additional features
• Screen wrap; If you move the robot out of the screen on the left or right edge, the robot gets teleported to the other side of the screen.
• Difficulty; The game is divided into seemingly transisioning stages, where each stage gradually increases the difficulty to add an extra challenge to the gameplay.
• Infinite lives; When you die by falling down off the screen, you will get respawned at start of section you died in.
